# Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-

this time I would like to share my experience when i was working on UAV project in Robotic Lab. 
First of all i will give you quick overview about this project.

Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) is a Quadcopter or drone competition organized by DSO National Laboratories, Science Center Singapore and supported by the Ministry of Defense Singapore (MINDEF). In development of quadcopter many problems are found, such as collisions or crashes against obstacles and other quadcopter on the fly. This project discusses a PID control method for manipulating pitch and roll based on the proximity sensor as collision avoidance. The information obtained is then processed by PID control before entering the quadcopter flight controller. every quadcopter movement will be observed and evaluated to obtain stable movement. Use of wireless communication and telemetry data to facilitate the control of quadcopter with ground stations

okay let's dive into the project!!!!
